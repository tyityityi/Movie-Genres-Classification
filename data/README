Overview
==========

This project implements a set of classifiers including Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron to predict movie genre. The classifiers are trained with various combination of features. 



The features and class labels are derived from the following published datasets.

Deldjoo,  Yashar  and  Constantin,  Mihai  Gabriel  and  Schedl,  Markus  and  Ionescu,  Bogdan 
andCremonesi, Paolo. MMTF-14K: A Multifaceted Movie Trailer Feature Dataset for Recommendation and Retrieval. Proceedings of the 9th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, MMSys 2018,Amsterdam, The Netherlands, June 12-15, 2018F. 

Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4, Article 19 (December 2015)

The dataset consists of movie genres, metadata, audio and visual features for 5774 movies. The movies are split into the following datasets:

* Training set: 5240 movies.
* Validation set: 299 movies.
* Test set: 235 movies.

Mainly used features in this project contains the followings:

* movieID: unique identifier for each movie (to be used for mapping movies to their labels)
* movieTitle: title of the movie. Type: text.
* Tag: A comma-separated list of tags assigned to the movie by human annotators. Type: text / categorical.
* avg1 ... avg107: 107 columns containing pre-computed visual features of the movie. These 
  features were pre-extracted from the movie trailer, and capture asthetic aspects of the 
  video. Each feature takes a continuous value. Type: float / continuous.
* ivec1 ... ivec20: 20 columns containing pre-computed audio features of the movie. These
  features were pre-extracted from the movie trailer, and capture a variety of sound features
  of the specific movie. Type: float / continuous

All genre labels are taken from the following set of 18 genres: Action, Adventure, Animation, Children, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Film_Noir, Horror, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci_fi, Thriller, War, Western

The main library used in this projects are: sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and nltk. 

==========
Workflow
==========

* 1st Cell: 
Read in data from .tsv files.
Drop irrelevant features from dataset.
Drop rows with missing value.
Vectorise the tag and title feature and extract audio and visual feature:
	- tf_tag: tag feature in training set
	- vf_tag: tag feature in validation set
	- tf_title: title feature in training set
	- vf_title: title feature in validation set
	- tf_audio: audio feature in training set
	- vf_audio: audio feature in validation set
	- tf_visual: visual feature in training set
	- vf_visual: visual feature in validation set	
Extract genre names and store in labels_name.

* 2nd Cell:
Find the most common genre in training set by counting the number of each genre.
Compute the accuracy of validation set by predicting all of the movies to the most common genre.

* 3rd Cell:
Define plot_confusion_matrix method to plot confusion matrix.

* 4th Cell:
Define trainModelWithFeatures method:
	- Input:
		- train_fea & test_fea: training and validation data with a combination of 		features.
		- tl & vl: labels of training and validation set.
The method prints accuracy, plots the heat map of confusion matrix for RF, LR and MLP classifier. 

* 5th - 20th Cells:
Display the performance of classifiers trained with hybrid combination of features.

* 21st - 24th Cells:
Plot the learning curve of classifiers.

* 25th Cell:
Predict the movie genre from test set using the classifier which has the best performance.
Save it into a .csv file.
